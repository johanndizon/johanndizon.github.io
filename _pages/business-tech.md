I take pride in my various STEM-related experiences, particularly from my time with [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 7157](https://team7157.com/). As team president, I learned the importance of combining the critical problem solving skills from engineering with a managerial mindset to run a successful, independently-run student organization. It was also through robotics the importance of communication, both within your organization and outside of it.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!
