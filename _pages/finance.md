At Brown University, the [Undergraduate Finance Board (UFB)](https://www.brownufb.org/) is concerned mainly with the financing of all student activities. These student activities range from student groups' concerts (such as Brown's Spring Weekend), performances, conferences, cultural celebrations, travel expenses, academic and career events, and so much more. UFB helps student groups that have objectives ranging from a few people to the entire campus.

Every year, $286 comes from each student's tuition to go towards the Brown Undergraduate Student Activities Fund. This Fund, roughly $2.5 million USD, is used to finance all and every student activity at Brown University. It is then the duty of UFB to properly allocate the Fund among student groups such that it is used in a fair, equitable, and transparent manner. UFB is also responsible for legislating and adjusting the relevant funding policies for student groups, to maintain the integrity and accessibility of the Student Activities Fund. UFB also helps student groups seek outside funding sources, such as grants from departments inside and outside of Brown.

For two years on UFB I served as an elected At-Large Board Member. I communicated with student groups throughout the school year and guided them on how they can obtain the necessary funding for whatever activity they planned to do. I worked with them to ensure that their budget requests are in line with UFB policy, as well as received feedback from them and the undergraduate student community to improve the funding and financing process. Then in twice-a-week meetings, I worked with the rest of the Board to deliberate and vote on budgets, as well as discuss and vote to modify Board policies.

At the end of each academic year, UFB compiles an annual budget for all student groups for the next academic year. This annual budget takes into consideration the performance and attendance of student groups, the events they put on, and takes special account of how the next year's campus-wide events will be funded. In coordination with the rest of the Brown Student Government Association, UFB helps to create a more inclusive and financially accessibile undergraduate experience at Brown University.
