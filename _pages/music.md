Music has always and will continue to be a crucial passion in my life. Going beyond just another hobby, I do believe that music has the power to connect beyond different tongues, cultures, and backgrounds. In line with my theme of understanding others, music continues to be my medium of artistic expression and bringing people together.

I am a conductor, arranger and editor, and multi instrumentalist. My main instruments are saxophone (from soprano to baritone, since 2011) and piano (since 2017). Other instruments I play include low brass such as trombone and euphonium, to elementary level percussion. While not very experienced (but with the help of perfect pitch), I can sing in tune at a tenor-baritone range.

My music education primarily centered around both classical and jazz circles; I believe that learning one can supplment performance in the other, and vice versa. It all started from participating in my elementary school's concert band program. In between everything I continued to participate in various wind ensembles, jazz band, orchestras, and I performed in marching band in high school for three years. It was also around my time in high school that I became increasingly interested in arranging, conducting, and leading ensembles.

At Brown University, I have continued my passion for music by taking music classes, participated in Brown's Wind Symphony, and most importantly, help arrange, conduct, and lead the Large Ensemble of [Anime Video Game Ensemble (AVGE)](https://www.youtube.com/@brownavge). AVGE is a unique music group that accepts students of any instrument, of any musical background. We play original sound tracks (OSTs) from anime and video games; through our Small Ensembles we have "chamber groups," bands and gigs, and through our Large Ensemble, we create the symphonic orchestra atmosphere. Being part of AVGE is truly my greatest honor and pleasure, thanks to its warm and loving community.
