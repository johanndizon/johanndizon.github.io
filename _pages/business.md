At Brown University, one of the three branches of student government, the Undergraduate Finance Board (UFB), is concerned mainly with the financing of all student activities. These student activities range from student groups' concerts, performances, conferences, cultural celebrations, travel expenses, academic and career events, and so much more. UFB helps student groups that have objectives ranging from a few people to the entire campus.

Every year, $286 comes from each student's tuition to go towards the Brown Undergraduate Student Activities Fund. This Fund, roughly $2 million, is used to finance all and every student activity at Brown University. It is then the duty of UFB to properly allocate the Fund among student groups such that it is used in a fair, equitable, and transparent manner. UFB is also responsible for legislating and adjusting the relevant funding policies for student groups, to maintain the integrity and accessibility of the Student Activities Fund.
