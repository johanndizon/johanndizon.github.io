At Brown University, one of the three branches of student government, the Undergraduate Finance Board (UFB), is concerned mainly with the financing of all student activities. These student activities range from student groups' concerts, performances, conferences, cultural celebrations, travel expenses, academic and career events, and so much more. UFB helps student groups that have objectives ranging from a few people to the entire campus.
