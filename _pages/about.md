I am currently a Master of Science student in Brown University School of Engineering Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PRIME). I am pursuing this degree as a part-time student, taking all of my classes online and slated to graduate in May 2026. This unique opportunity allows me to pursue a Master of Science degree while still being able to work full time.

I am also Brown University undergraduate from the class of 2024, with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Economics and Political Science. Through my studies, I learned how to focus on the intersection of economics and politics to make more informed decisions.

I believe that my diverse background has given me not just a more fulfilling life, but also a better understanding of how the world works. Ranging from business and politics, STEM and entrepreneurship, and music and foreign languages, my experiences allow me to think critically and solve any problem in any situation. Most importantly, I learned the importance of integrity, honesty, teamwork, and understanding each other.
