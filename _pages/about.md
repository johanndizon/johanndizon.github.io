I am a Brown University undergraduate from the class of 2024, with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Economics and Political Science. Through my studies, I focus on the intersection of economics and politics to make more informed decisions. I have also been accepted to Brown's Master of Science Program in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME) and am currently deferring my accepted admission.

I believe that my diverse background has given me not just a more fulfilling life, but also a better understanding of how the world works. Ranging from business and politics, STEM and entrepreneurship, and music and foreign languages, my experiences allow me to think critically and solve any problem in any situation. Most importantly, I learned the importance of integrity, honesty, teamwork, and understanding each other.
